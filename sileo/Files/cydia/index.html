<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cydia Installer</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hosted on repo.cf/sileo, this version of the Cydia Installer was originally hosted on Procursus, before being taken down.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You will only view this depiction on Sileo/Sileo-based package managers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You will probably encounter issues such as APT being unable to find the .deb file for this Cydia. Try installing Zebra first and use that to install to bypass this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Any issues you should email <a href="mailto:btebusinessp@gmail.com">btebusinessp@gmail.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thank you!</p>
